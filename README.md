## How to play

### Singleplayer

```bash
# start the game with no option and enjoy it
$ ./pong
```

### Multiplayer

We should have a server which host the game and a client to play with.

The server should start before the client and It's it which handle the whole
game.

#### How to start the server

```bash
$ ./pong --server 127.0.0.1:3000
```

#### How to start the client

```bash
$ ./pong --client 127.0.0.1:3000
```
